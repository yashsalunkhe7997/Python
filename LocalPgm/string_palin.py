# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For example:

# "radar" is a palindrome be


# a="yash"

# for i in a:
#     result=a[::-1]



# if a==result:
#     print(f"{result} :string is palindrome ")
# else:
#     print(f"{result } is not palindrome ")
